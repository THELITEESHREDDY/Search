Quick walk through of Search Engine

1Ô∏è‚É£ Searching: Search Query gets Tokenized and sent to robot.txt file where there are webcrawlers (are used to find the matching key words in the webpages meta data or meta tag to get matching characters).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Inverting Indexing: Generally, there are some keywords that will map to particular websites (this may include domain name, niche of web site, key-words mentioned in their meta tags etc) this is in the form of 

map data structure
  
 key-words : document Id's

3Ô∏è‚É£Results: Retriving from that map with the help of key-words , this is done by web crawlers(spiders) as a response.

Web crawlers goes to robot.txt files in web pages, matches the data with robot.txt files of web-sites and ranks them based on keyword matching.
